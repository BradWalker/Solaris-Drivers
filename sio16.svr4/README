Brad Walker (bwalker@auratek.com), October 28, 1996

This README describes release 5.13 of sio16, the 
Solaris 2 driver for the CD180/CD1865 series of boards.

This release was based on 5.11b.  Note that there never was any
release called 5.12.  The deltas described herein are with
respect to 5.11b.

Notice
------
This is a general release.  It may be distributed freely.

CVS information

Purpose
-------

[5.13]: The primary purpose of the 5.13 release is to fix a problem
with forceload on UltraSPARC systems running Solaris 2.5.1.  Also,
several bugs have been fixed and performance has been improved.

[5.13qa3]: The primary purpose of the 5.13qa3 release is to fix 
the DDI_SUSPEND/DDI_RESUME problem under Solaris 2.5

[5.13qa2]: The primary purpose of the 5.13qa2 release is to fix 
some problems that were discovered in the QA cycle.  Also, a great
deal of engineering work has been done on the receive half of the
driver (performance and functionality improvements).

[5.13qa1]: The primary purpose of the 5.13qa1 release is to fix a
problem with forceload on UltraSPARC systems running Solaris 2.5.1.
In addition, this release switches to the new, standard Solaris 2
xxtrace, and fixes many other deficiencies in the driver.  Also, it is
the first release to include drat, and it is the first release to have
a proper README.staging (what you're looking at).

    Async driver (sio16)
    --------------------

    + [5.13qa2]: 1600SE Revision B hardware not fully supported

    The 1600SE Revision B hardware is not fully supported by this
    driver (and probably has never been fully supported).  It is not
    believed that any Rev. B hardware is in the field.

    The problem is that the software cannot distinguish between the
    1600SE Rev. A and the 1600SE Rev. B.  Unfortunately, the two
    boards have their DTR and RTS pins wired in opposite ways.
    Because the Rev. A hardware is in the field, the driver assumes
    that a board that looks like either a Rev. A or B is actually a
    Rev. A board.  This has the side effect that Rev. B hardware will
    not quite work properly.

    Specifically, the DTR and RTS pins will behave backwardly.  If the
    user uses the Aurora "async modem adapters", the problem will be
    solved.

    This was reported as bug 0000000141.

    + [5.13qa1]: termiox ioctls are not supported

    This version of the driver does not support the termiox ioctls.
    This should not be a problem for most users, as these ioctls are
    somewhat obscure.  It should be noted that, at this time, *NO*
    Aurora products support these ioctls.
    
    + [5.13qa1]: high level interrupts are not supported

    This version of the driver does not support high level
    interrupts.  This means that, for example, SBus interrupts level 6
    and 7, which may be selected using the 'sio16.conf' file, will not
    work on sun4m machines.  This should not be a problem for most
    users, as the default configuration sets the interrupt level at 5.
    Also, it should be noted that, at this time, *NO* Aurora products
    support high level interrupts.

    + [5.13qa1]: only first 16 boards have summary statistics

    The definition of SIO_STATS_CHK ioctl allows only 16 boards for
    summary statistics.  The driver will present these 'check'
    statistics for the first 16 units (board instances 0-15).  Boards
    with higher instance numbers will not have summary statistics
    recorded.

    This should not be a problem for most users, as users rarely have
    more than 16 boards in a single system.  However, even if they do,
    it is only the summary statistics (the ones retrieved by
    SIO_STATS_CHK -- e.g. from 'mset -statschk') that are affected;
    regular, per-line statistics will function properly on all
    boards.

    + [5.13qa1]: some Solaris 2.5 extended baud rates are not
      supported

    The currently shipping 1600SE hardware (Rev. C) uses an 11.0592
    MHz clock.  The CL-CD180 uses this clock to generate its baud
    rate.  Some of the high-end baud rates (153600, 307200, and
    460800) do not divide properly into 11.0592 MHz.  The baud rates
    are therefore illegal.  Attempting to use them will leave the baud
    rate unchanged.

    Note that although the driver "supports" the Solaris 2.5 higher
    baud rates (57600-460800), the hardware is not officially capable
    of operating at these speeds.  The CL-CD180 is not specified to
    operate much above 64 kbps, and the transceivers on the 1600SE
    will probably start to fail at about 120 kbps.

    + [5.13qa1]: Solaris 2.5 DDI_SUSPEND/DDI_RESUME functions are not
      implemented

    The Solaris 2.5 DDI_SUSPEND and DDI_RESUME functions are not
    implemented in this release of the driver.  This means that users
    *may* not be able to suspend their machine (using the
    sys-suspend(1M) command, or the power key).  The driver will
    refuse to allow the system to be suspended.

    + [5.13qa1]: differing input and output baud rates are not
      supported

    This driver will not support operation with different input and
    output baud rates.  If an application attempts to configure a port
    with input and output baud rates that are not the same, the driver
    will ignore the new input baud rate and use only the output baud
    rate. 

    This should not be a problem for most users, as most applications
    involve using the same baud rate for input and output.  If
    differing input and output baud rates are needed, the customer can
    use two separate ports: one configured for input, and the other
    for output.

    Also, it should be noted that, at this time, *NO* Aurora products
    support differing input and output baud rates.

Change descriptions
-------------------

    Internal
    --------

    + [5.13]: the AURAdas8 packaging files have been removed

    The files needed to create the AURAdas8 (drat) package have been
    removed.  This functionality will now live in the diag180
    repository. 

    + [5.13qa2]: modem/flow control line internal mechanism changed

    The old driver used a combinations of flags and the value of the
    port number (e.g. >= 0xc && <= 0xf) to determine how the modem
    and flow control lines were wired up.  This was *very* confusing,
    and led to several bugs.

    I've restructured the driver to use a single variable for each
    logical signal (DTR, RTS, CTS, CD, and DSR) to describe where it
    is attached to the chip.  These variables are initialized at board
    attach time.  This makes it much easier to add new configurations
    (e.g. the new 1600PCI board).

    + [5.13qa2]: modem interrupt internal mechanism changed

    The code in the modem interrupt routine used to have two cases:
    one for when CD was connected to DSR, the other for when it was
    connected to CTS (the "high" ports).  As part of the
    above-mentioned changes, these two cases have been simplified and
    folded into one.

    + [5.13qa2]: receive mechanism rewritten

    The old driver had a very ugly design in the rsrv routine to drain
    the receive data ring.  Among other problems, it would fragment
    the data into small mblks, it would queue data in the local
    receive queue, it would not recover gracefully when allocb()
    failed, and it would sometimes turn receive flow control off when
    it shouldn't.  These flaws could lead to data loss or poor
    performance.

    I've completely re-written the receive half of the driver.  Data
    are left in the receive ring until a mblk is available, and the
    receive flow control is now based on a low water mark.

    + [5.13qa1]: code reformatted to Aurora standards

    I reformatted the code to meet the Aurora coding standards (4
    space indentation, mandatory opening and closing braces after all
    conditionals, boolean expressions only (no arithmetic expressions)
    with conditionals, fully ANSIfied code, complete and proper
    prototypes, standard Aurora copyright boilerplate, RCS ids and
    copyrights, no long lines).

    + [5.13qa1]: extraneous includes removed

    The driver source contained many unnecessary includes.  They have
    been removed, and the includes pared down to the bare minimum.
    This is to increase DDI/DKI compliance.

    + [5.13qa1]: new version mechanism

    The old driver derived a version number from the sccsid of the
    sio16_osdep.c module.  This was a bizarre way of doing things.

    The version is now stored in the 'version.h' file.

    + [5.13qa1]: new makefile setup

    The makefile setup has been changed to mimic that of ACS.  This
    will allow parallel builds under SPARC and Solaris x86 (in
    preparation for the PCI board).  In addition, a new set of targets
    have been added: release, transfer, image, id, and clean.

    + [5.13qa1]: driver uses ddi_soft_state

    The driver now uses the ddi_soft_state mechanism to store the
    per-board information.  The eliminates the restriction on the
    maximum number of boards.  However, there are still other
    limitations (see above).

    + [5.13qa1]: support for SunOS 4 removed from source code

    The old driver had the remnants of support for SunOS 4 in the
    source.  This has been expunged.

    + [5.13qa1]: hardware definitions moved to cd18x.h

    All of the hardware definitions of the Cirrus Logic
    CL-CD180/1864/1865 have been moved out of sio16.h and into cd18x.h.

    General
    -------

    + [5.13]: the AURAdas8 package is no longer on the shipping medium

    The qa versions of 5.13 included a version (1.0.2qaX) of diag180,
    the Aurora diagnostics for the CL-CD180/1865, in a package called
    'AURAdas8'.

    We decided that it was confusing to have the two, conflicting
    packages on the same diskette.  If a user attempted to install
    both packages, they would get a failure on the installation of the
    second package.

    In addition, coupling the release of AURAdas8 to the release of
    the driver made it more cumbersome to QA and release.

    So, we decided to ship the two packages on separate media.

    + [5.13qa2]: bug fix: xxtrace saw only first board

    In the old driver, xxtrace only saw the first board.  This was due
    to a bug in the attach code that only initialized xxtrace for the
    first board attached.  This has been fixed.

    + [5.13qa2]: bugfix: 'mset -statsreset' would crash the system

    The old driver had a bug in the xxtrace code for the
    SIO_STATS_RST_ALL ioctl (used by 'mset -statsreset').  It used 0
    as the device pointer.  This has been fixed.

    + [5.13qa1]: driver compiled with Sun SPARCompiler C 4.0

    Previous releases of the driver were compiled with the Sun
    SPARCompiler C 2.0.1 under Solaris 2.3.  Unfortunately, this
    combination of compiler and operating system causes the driver to
    hang UltraSPARC systems at reboot time.

    Therefore, this release will be built with the Sun SPARCompiler C
    4.0 on a Solaris 2.3 machine.

    + [5.13qa1]: included drat (diag180) into the release package 

    Previous releases of the driver did not include a diagnostic tool.
    This release includes a separate package called 'AURAdas8' that
    has a self-contained diagnostic called 'drat'.

    + [5.13qa1]: removed Readme from distribution

    Previous releases of the driver contained a Readme file.  This
    Readme had not been kept up to date, so it has been removed from
    the distribution.

    In addition, the postinstall script (run at pkgadd time) would ask
    the user if they wanted to read this file.  This query has been
    removed.

    + [5.13qa1]: new standard xxtrace

    This release switches to the new, standard Solaris 2 xxtrace.
    This xxtrace has many features and bugfixes in it.  The biggest
    feature is the timestamp capability.

    + [5.13qa1]: only xxtrace driver is shipping

    Previous releases of this software contained two versions of the
    driver: one with xxtrace compiled in and one without.  By default,
    the non-xxtrace version was installed into the kernel.

    This release of the software contains ONLY the driver with
    xxtrace.  This is to try to clear up some confusion, make the
    build process simpler, and make it easier to trace problems that
    may happen on the fly.  The overhead of a deactivated xxtrace is
    quite minimal.

    + [5.13qa1]: UltraSPARC compatible filesystem packaging

    The software used to be distributed in "pkgadd stream format".
    This format is incredibly slow to build and slow to load.

    Therefore, starting with this release, the distribution will be in
    filesystem format.  In addition, the parameters of this filesystem
    make it mountable on UltraSPARC machines.

    + [5.13qa1]: updated copyrights

    All copyrights have been updated to include 1996.

    Async driver (sio16)
    --------------------

    + [5.13qa3]: driver 'modinfo' tag line changed

    The description of the driver used to look like:
	aurora 16 port serial

    This is ugly and not very descriptive.  The new modinfo
    tag line looks like:
	Aurora CL-CD180/1865 driver

    This is a little more in keeping with how Sun uses their
    module descriptions.

    + [5.13qa3]: DDI_SUSPEND/DDI_RESUME now fails more gracefully

    The old driver did not protect properly against the
    DDI_SUSPEND/DDI_RESUME function.  The driver would allow the
    system to SUSPEND, but it would refuse to resume.  This would
    cause a system panic when the system tried to resume.

    The driver will now refuse to suspend.

    + [5.13qa2]: driver displays a more comprehensive load line

    The old driver displayed a load line like:

	Aurora 1600SE board:X, CD180-Z, intr I, 5.13qa1

    Where X was the instance, I was the SBus interrupt level, and Z
    was the revision of the chip (either A, B, or D), based on the
    contents of the gfrcr register.

    Now, the load line looks like this:

	Aurora 1600SE board:X, Y-Z S MHz, intr I, 5.13qa2

    Where Y is the chip type (either "CL-CD180", "CL-CD1864", or
    "CL-CD1865"), Z is the chip revision (A, B, or C for the CL-CD180,
    A for the CL-CD1864, or A for the CL-CD1865), and S is the board
    speed (either 11.0592 MHz for the 1600SE Rev. C, or 14.7456 MHz
    for the 1600SE Rev. A).

    Note that it appears that Cirrus released the CL-CD180 Rev. D
    before Rev. C, and that both have the same internal version code.
    This means that boards with Rev. D CL-CD180s in them will report
    Rev. C CL-CD180s instead.  Note also that the old driver reported
    both Rev. C and D CL-CD180s as Rev. D.

    The purpose of all of this is to try to help distinguish the board
    type and revision to users.  Please see bug id 0000000142.

    + [5.13qa2]: driver fails more gracefully when encountering an old
      board

    If the driver is installed on a system with an old board, whose
    name is still 'sio16' but whose model is not '1600se', then it
    prints out a warning message that includes the value of the model
    property (e.g. '1600sm').  This should make the failure a little
    easier to deal with.

    + [5.13qa2]: input hardware flow control bugs fixed

    The old driver had a bug where hardware input flow control would
    fail when the receiving channel was simultaneously transmitting.
    The problem was that when the driver got data to transmit, it
    would always turn on *all* interrupts (including receive).  This
    would defeat the hardware input flow control mechanism (on
    configurations that used the built-in DTR hardware input flow
    control).

    The new driver is much more careful about writing to the interrupt
    enable register (SRER).  It keeps a cached value of SRER and does
    anding and oring with this cached copy (to decrease the number of
    chip cycles).

    In addition, the old driver used to always re-activate data
    reception after rsrv was called, even if rsrv didn't drain
    anything out of the receive ring.  This created a nasty race
    condition that could lead to loss of data.

    rsrv now uses a low-water mark mechanism in order to decide when
    to re-activate data reception.

    + [5.13qa1]: removed support for all previous revisions of the
      products. 

    The driver now only supports the 1600SE Rev. C hardware.  All
    support for previous versions has been removed.  This means that,
    among other things, this driver will not support the 1600S or the
    1600SM.

    + [5.13qa1]: transparent ioctls are now fully implemented

    The transparent ioctl code from ACSA has been lifted and placed
    into this driver.  This means that all ioctls are now supported in
    their transparent form.

    + [5.13qa1]: Solaris 2.5 extended baud rates supported

    Solaris 2.5 introduced extended baud rates (above 38400).  This
    driver supports these (even though it is built on a Solaris 2.3
    system).  There are caveats, however.  Please see "Known problems"
    (above) for details.

    + [5.13qa1]: changed name of close_timeout to sio16_close_timeout

    The variable 'close_timeout' has been renamed
    'sio16_close_timeout'.  This is an attempt to avoid name conflicts
    with other drivers.

    Note that this variable is of questionable use, and it will
    probably be removed in a future release of this driver.

    + [5.13qa1]: ports initialized to "ttymodes" at first open

    The old driver initialized the parameters of a port to 9600 baud,
    7e1, IXON | IXOFF at open time.  This is not really Solaris 2
    friendly.  Solaris 2 provides the "ttymodes" property (see the
    file /kernel/drv/options.conf).  The driver now initializes the
    port to the values from the "ttymodes" property.

    + [5.13qa1]: improved error recovery in attach

    The old driver had some resources leaks in the attach code; if the
    attach failed, then some resources would be left unaccounted-for.

    This release of the driver has a newly restructured attach routine
    that will recover more gracefully from failures.
