+ cache values for things like some of the COR and MCOR registers.

+ re-write receive process to involve no high level calls in ISR;
  place all data and status pairs directly into a ring buffer, and
  process them in rsrv() routine.  This leaves two possible data loss
  points: one in the ISR (placing data into the ring), and another in
  the chip FIFO itself.  This would also allow a more standard method
  of handling exceptions (parity, frame errors) in the rsrv routine.

+ re-structure receive-half to work more consistently with an 'icto'
  type variable.  Here's how: at the low level, use icto to program
  the chip's true icto -- that is, how long it waits with data in the
  buffer and no new data arriving.  Also use the icto to program the
  high water mark in the chip's FIFO.

  Next, use icto at the high level to determine the water mark used in
  the interrupt routine to qenable the queue.  We could use a magic
  value of icto (e.g. '0') that would indicate "always qenable".

+ borrow open() code from ACSA to support cu/term simultaneous opens
  correctly 

+ switch to macrofied chip access

+ figure out how to release a Solaris 2.3/2.4 and Solaris 2.5/2.5.1
  versions of driver from same source simultaneously

+ eliminate all board maxima (including in the statistics mechanism)

+ implement 'mset -flush' mechanism

+ implement 'mset -icto' mechanism

+ cache cflag/iflag to determine whether or not param changes are
  necessary (a la ACSA)

+ fix? hangup detection (doesn't seem to work with kermit)

+ implement split input and output baud rates

+ implement termiox ioctls

+ add support for DDI_SUSPEND/DDI_RESUME in the detach/attach
  routines

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things that have been completed:

+ use xxtrace as standard driver.  Modify sourceme to simplify xxtrace
  loading whatever. 

+ borrow transparent ioctl code from ACSA to properly support
  transparent ioctls

+ switch to new version mechanism

+ use UltraSPARC-compatible packaging

+ add 'make id' target

+ add a 'README.staging'

+ move to standard XXTRACE

+ use 'ttymodes' property to initialize termio stuff

+ switch to ddi_soft_state

+ remove support for old boards

+ ansify properly

+ add Solaris 2.5 extended baud rates

+ remove 'Readme' from shipping package

+ remove question about seeing 'Readme' from postinstall

+ remove 'AURAsio16/sio16' and 'AURAsio16/sio16xx' from shipping package

+ cache values for things like the IER (also called SRER)
